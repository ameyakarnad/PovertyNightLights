# Finding relation between Night Lights data and economic factors related to Poverty

Surveys data of household income and consumption have been traditionally used by researchers to
measure economic activities, wealth, and poverty. However, there are many limitations of this
methodology. Generating national survey needs a very large sample, and doing so is very
expensive. This results in a major data gap as many countries do not conduct surveys continuously,
which makes it harder to conduct analysis with.

Big data in the form of night lights data, other satellite data, social media data, and mobile phone
patterns offers an alternate route to understand socio-economic factors in data scarce regions. In the
past few decades, researchers has developed alternative techniques to estimate poverty using
information provided through satellites. The advantage of using big data is that they are abundant,
can enable real-time analysis, it does not depend on the government action to collect (eg. survey),
and with the publicly available data like the nightlights, it comes out more economical.

Various research predicting socio-economic activities has been done using night-time light data. The
research that we are focusing this time is Provill et al. (2017). 

The Project uses linear and Lasso regressions to find correlation between night lights and the economic factors and fit the model. We also looking at time series models to try and fit night lights data with various economic factors
